# SYSC 4005 Group Project

This code is used to run the simulation study of a factory system using historical data and
randomly generated data.

How to run:
1. unpack all files from the .zip folder
2. Install the libraries: simpy, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas.
3. Run "main.py" to start the simulation.
4. You will be asked to select number of replications and simulation time, both can be changed but have default values of 1000, 30000seconds.
